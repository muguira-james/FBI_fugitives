Scrape the web for data for NEC SAP POC.

The data is a json file of FBI data.  I use topten and fugitives to populate.

This is a rough cut as there are a lot of things not done!

webscrape.py has 2 hard codes: the initial URL to scrape and the image dir name.  It is tailored for this simple job.  If the URL changes the program changes.
