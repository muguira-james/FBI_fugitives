Scrape the web for data for my crime project.

The data is a json file of FBI data.  

This is a rough cut as there are a lot of things not done!

This project contains 3 things:

1. a node app for view place of birth info on a map

2. a set of tools to scrape fugitive info from the FBI

3. a set of tools to format the fugitive data for the node app

4. a named entity recognizer

5. data files

#1

app.js = the node driver, web server

index.html = the web page

package.json = the node package file

#2

le.py = longExtract.py - this reads a data file and creates
      a json db with images and details of the fugitives

de.py = compiles a little data on the classifications of crimes

fbiwebscrape.py = the first version of le.py

#3

extract_place.py = reads the fbi_db.json file, writes list.csv

creategeo.py = experiments with geocoding

#4

ensemble.py = experiments in NER

#5

data-1.json = created by artoo (see le for instructions)

fbi_db.json = create by le

list.csv = created by extract_place.py
